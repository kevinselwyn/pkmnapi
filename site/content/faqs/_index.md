1. **How much does `pkmnapi` cost to use?**

Nothing (for now). It is a free service.

2. **Where can I download a copy of Pokémon Red/Blue?**

I don't know. Or rather, I do, but I'm not telling. Please obtain Game Boy ROMs legally (i.e. a backup of your own physical copy).

See the [Disclaimer](@/disclaimer/_index.md) section for more reasons why.

3. **Can I use `pkmnapi` to create a mod?**

Yes! That was one of the intended goals of this project. See the section on [Changing Data](@/changing-data/_index.md) for some concrete examples of how to create a mod.

4. **Can I add new Pokémon?**

Yes and no. Additional Pokémon may not be added, but Pokémon may be totally replaced (new name, new type, new pic). There must always be 151 Pokémon.

5. **Where is MissingNo.?**

MissingNo.'s appearance in the game is due to a glitch and can appear differently depending what is currently in RAM. Since `pkmnapi` only consumes the _ROM_, it is not currently a goal to allow access to MissingNo.

For some great background on the glitch, check out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZI50XUeN6QE" target="_blank">this video</a> by Retro Game Mechanics Explained.

6. **How can I contribute?**

Feel free to open issues or pull requests on the <a href="https://github.com/kevinselwyn/pkmnapi" target="_blank">GitHub repo</a>.
