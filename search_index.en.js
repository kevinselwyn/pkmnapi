Gym leaders (with the exception of Giovanni) only have 1 party because they are only battled once.\n\nNow let's fill his party with a bunch of level 5 Geodude!\nThe game stores parties in 1 of 2 ways:\n\nAll Pokémon are the same level: all that has to be stored is the level of all Pokémon and their Pokédex IDs\nAll Pokémon are not the same level: each Pokémon is stored with their level and their Pokédex ID\n\nBecause the first way takes up less space, we can actually fill BROCK's party with 4 Geodude of the same level, where before he only had room for a Geodude and Onix of different levels.\nLet's do so by sending a request to the POST /v1/trainers/parties/:trainer_id endpoint:\n\n\n\n    bash\n\n\n    js\n\n\n\ncurl \\\n    -X POST \\\n    -H 'Authorization: Bearer

It is a free service.\n\nWhere can I download a copy of Pokémon Red/Blue?\n\nI don't know. Or rather, I do, but I'm not telling. Please obtain Game Boy ROMs legally (i.e. a backup of your own physical copy).\nSee the Disclaimer section for more reasons why.\n\nCan I use pkmnapi to create a mod?\n\nYes! That was one of the intended goals of this project. See the section on Changing Data for some concrete examples of how to create a mod.\n\nCan I add new Pokémon?\n\nYes and no. Additional Pokémon may not be added, but Pokémon may be totally replaced (new name, new type, new pic). There must always be 151 Pokémon.\n\nWhere is MissingNo.?\n\nMissingNo.'s appearance in the game is due to a glitch and can appear differently depending what is currently in RAM. Since pkmnapi only consumes the ROM, it is not currently a goal to allow access to MissingNo.\nFor some great background on the glitch, check out this video by Retro Game Mechanics Explained.\n\nHow can I contribute?\n\nFeel free to open issues or pull requests on the GitHub repo.\n","id":"https://www.pkmnapi.com/faqs/","title":"FAQs"},"https://www.pkmnapi.com/getting-started/creating-an-access-token/":{"body":"All requests sent to pkmnapi must be authenticated using an access token.\nTo create an access token, send request to POST /v1/access_tokens with a valid email address:\n\n⚠️ Requests sent to POST /v1/access_tokens are the only ones that must be unauthenticated\n\n\n\n\n    bash\n\n\n    js\n\n\n\ncurl \\\n    -X POST \\\n    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\\n    -d '{\n    \"data\": {\n        \"type\": \"access_tokens\",\n        \"attributes\": {\n            \"email_address\": \"your@email.com\"\n        }\n    }\n}' \\\n    https://api.pkmnapi.com/v1/access_tokens\n\n\nconst xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();\n\nxhr.addEventListener('load', () =&gt; {\n    console.log(xhr.response);\n});\n\nxhr.open('POST', 'https://api.pkmnapi.com/v1/access_tokens', true);\nxhr.setRequestHeader('Content-Type', 'application/json');\nxhr.send(JSON.stringify({\n    data: {\n        type: 'access_tokens',\n        attributes: {\n            email_address: 'your@email.com'\n        }\n    }\n}));\n\nAn email containing your access token will be sent to the provided email address.\n\n📄 To prevent the frivolous generation of access tokens, there is a rate limit of 10 minutes on the POST /v1/access_tokens endpoint per email address\n\n\n📄 Want more than 1 access token with the same email address?
